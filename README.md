# Calculator

## About
Calculator created with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
I especially improved my knowledge of:
- CSS by using grid and position to arrange the elements that way, making the animations, making it responsive...
- JavaScript by doing key mapping (and giving feedback when pressed), changing the theme...

It took some work, but I really liked the result.
